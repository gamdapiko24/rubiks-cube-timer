# Cube Timer

DISCLAIMER: I AM A COMPLETE BEGINNER AT PYTHON. THIS CODE MIGHT SUCK

Anyways this is a text based Rubik's Cube timer I coded in python because I like Rubik's Cubes. I can do one in 25 seconds average.

# How to use

Before starting, run main.py

1. Choose the event you want to use. You can't get custom scrambles for any puzzle other than 3x3 yet. You can type 'Commands' if you want to use commands instead of cubing.
2. It will give you a scramble and you can type in your time (I should probably add a feature so you can time yourself within the project)
3. After that, you can add a comment to your solve.
4. Type in a command. If you don't want to type a command, just type 'no'. If you want to exit the timer, type 'quit'.
5. Repeat

# Commands
**stats_from_index**: Shows you the solve stats for that index (Starts with zero)

**best**: Gives you your best time, mo3, ao5, ao12, or mean.

**worst**: Gives you your worst time, mo3, ao5, ao12 or mean.

**list_times**: Shows you all your times in order.

**search_times**: Shows you every time with a time of x.

**sort_best**: Sorts your times, mo3, ao5, ao12, or mean.

# What I plan to fix/add
1. Add more event scrambles.
2. Time yourself within project
3. Type nothing if you don't want to type a command.
4. Fix ao3, ao5, and ao12 'Null' bug.
